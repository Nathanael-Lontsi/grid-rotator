# grid-rotator project
This is a grid rotator whose UI is designed as follows: 9 buttons labeled 1 to 9 in a 3 x 3 dimensional grid in which the buttons are found. The essence of this exercise is to show how the outer buttons of the rotator can move clockwise when the middle button is pressed and anticlockwise when the any other button is pressed.
